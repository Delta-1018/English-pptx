              <strong>King of Lydia:</strong> Croesus was the king of Lydia,
              located in present-day Turkey. He ruled from around 595 BC to 546
              BC.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Extremely Rich:</strong> Croesus gained incredible wealth
              through his ancestral fortune and control over the gold-rich
              Pactolus River.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Happiest of Mortals:</strong> He famously considered
              himself the happiest of mortals, especially after consulting the
              Oracle of Delphi. (The Oracle of Delphi predicted that crossing
              the river would destroy a great empire. Croesus misinterpreted
              this as Persia's downfall, inflating his ego and making him feel
              the wealthiest, strongest, and happiest of mortals. However, it
              was his own kingdom that was ultimately destroyed.)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Treatment of His People:</strong> Croesus ensured his
              people’s needs were met, providing essentials such as health,
              food, water and even paid vacations while maintaining firm control
              over his rule.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Defeat: </strong> Croesus was eventually defeated by Cyrus
              the Great of Persia, marking the fall of Lydia and the end of his
              reign.

            <h2>Solon’s shaming of Croesus</h2>
            <p>
              Solon, an Athenian lawmaker, visited King Croesus of Lydia, who
              boasted about being the happiest man due to his wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solon named Tellus of Athens as the happiest man, praising his
              honorable life, family, and heroic death for his city.
            </p>
            <p>
              He warned that true happiness isn’t measured by wealth but by a
              well-lived life and a good ending.
            </p>
            <p>
              While about to be executed by King Cyrus, Croesus called out
              Solon’s name, making Cyrus reconsider and spare him.
            </p>

            <h2>Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</h2>
            <p>
              Adopted on December 10, 1948, by the United Nations General
              Assembly,championed by Eleanor Roosevelt, with 48 nations in favor
              and none against.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drafted under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, it became the
              first international document defining universal human rights after
              WWII.
            </p>
            <p>
              Contains 30 articles, ensuring freedom of speech, equality, fair
              trials, education, and protection from torture.
            </p>
            <p>
              FDR’s Second Bill of Rights (1944) proposed economic rights like
              jobs, healthcare, and housing—reflected in UDHR Articles 22-27.

            <h2>Cold war</h2>
            <p>
              A geopolitical struggle between the U.S. (capitalism) and the USSR
              (communism), shaping global politics for nearly 50 years
            </p>
            <p>
              No direct war, but fought through proxy wars like the Korean War
              (1950–1953), Vietnam War (1955–1975), and Soviet-Afghan War
              (1979–1989)
            </p>
            <p>
              Space Race rivalry led to Sputnik (1957), the first satellite, and
              Apollo 11 (1969), the first moon landing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989) and the collapse of
              the Soviet Union (1991), marking the victory of capitalism over
              communism.

              Samuel Moyn is an American historian and professor of law and
              history at Yale University since 2017. He is known for his work on
              intellectual history, legal thoughts and human rights. His works
              critically examines the role of human rights in today’s world and
              argues that while human rights have gained such popularity lately
              but it have failed to address economic inequality which is one of
              the most pressing global issues.
            </p>

            <p>
              Human rights and economic inequality: His central idea in this
              essay is that while human right have gained unprecedented moral
              and legal recognition, it has largely failed to combat
              socioeconomic inequality. This idea is further discussed in his
              work “Not enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World(2018)” where he
              express how human rights developed alongside neoliberal economic
              policies prioritize market freedom than distributive justice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Historical Perspective on Human Rights: In his book “The Last
              Uthopia: Human Rights in History” he challenges the beliefs that
              human right have been long standing best historical principle.
              Supporting the arguments he address that human rights that emerged
              in 1970s as a result of failure of the then socialist and
              anti-colonial movement was appropriate for that society but since
              we have developed a lot since then so it is not applicable today.
              Rather than focusing on economic fairness its vison is to form a
              legalistic and moralistic society. This perspective helps explain
              why global institutions like the United Nations and international
              human rights organizations often focus on political oppression but
              rarely push for radical economic redistribution. For example,
              while international law condemns state-sponsored torture and
              discrimination, there are no binding global commitments to tax the
              wealthy, provide universal healthcare, or guarantee economic
              security.

            </h2>

            "Writing the history of human rights in relation to that of
            political economy would involve two big stages with a possible
            missed oppuritinity in between."

            <h3>Heroic age of the national welfare states</h3>

            <p>
              The period after World War II, during the rise of national welfare

              After the war, there was a global consensus around welfare,
              especially in the context of the Cold War. Despite ideological
              divides between East and West (the Communist and the Capiltalist),
              there was agreement on the importance of socio-economic rights,
              which were seen as essential to social stability and prosperity.
              Both sides (to varying degrees) supported the idea of a welfare
              state that ensured a floor of protection for citizens, and in some
              cases, a ceiling on inequality.

              Capitalist nations, especially in Western Europe and America even
              though they didn't go as far as their socialist counterparts, were
              nonetheless committed to welfarism. They saw the need for welfare
              policies in part due to the social and economic misery they had
              experienced during the Great Depression, rather than solely from
              the fear of communism. This led to the development of welfare
              systems that aimed to provide economic security and reduce
              inequality.
            </p>

            <p>
              The consensus in the Capitalistic countries went beyond the realms
              of Croesus's world of basic floor of protection to creating the
              ceiling on inequality itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              There were various social systems established for making a
              national welfare state:

              <li>Christian Democracy</li>
              <li>Social Democracy</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              The human rights in the 1940s were not taken as the ultimate goal
              but just a modest first step for the better. This reflects the
              idea that, while human rights were a critical advancement, they
              were not necessarily the grand, final ideal for society. Human
              rights in this context were more about providing basic protection
              and ensuring a minimum standard of living, rather than aspiring to
              a utopian society. This was why they were viewed by many as a
              necessary step, but not the comprehensive solution to all
              problems.s

            <h3>The Second Bill of Rights (The Missed Oppurstinity)</h3>

            <p>
              Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882–1945) was the 32nd President of the
              United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. He was a
              central figure in American history, leading the country through
              the Great Depression and most of World War II.

              The Second Bill of Rights was a proposal put forward by Franklin
              D. Roosevelt in his 1944 State of the Union address. It was not a
              formal amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but rather a vision for
              expanding the rights of American citizens beyond the traditional
              civil and political rights laid out in the original Bill of
              Rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Second Bill of Rights" proposed a series
              of socio-economic rights that aimed to complement the existing
              civil and political rights in the U.S. Constitution. Roosevelt
              envisioned these rights as guarantees of economic security and
              social justice, including the right to employment, housing,
              education, social security and healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Roosevelt believed these rights were essential for ensuring
              freedom from want and providing a foundation for a more
              egalitarian society.While the proposal was not enacted during
              Roosevelt’s lifetime, it became a foundation for later welfare
              state policies in the US.

              There are three major facts about the proposal of the Second Bill
              of Rights.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b
                  >Late and ginger entry into an already foreordained North
                  Atlantic Consensus: </b
                >Roosevelt’s speech came at a time when many Western nations,
                particularly in Europe, had already begun embracing the concept
                of social welfare and entitlements to ensure economic security.
                Roosevelt’s call was seen as a “late and ginger entry” into a
                pre-existing global consensus around welfarism: the idea that
                governments had a duty to provide for the welfare of their
                citizens, particularly in the aftermath of economic hardship and
                war. This suggests that Roosevelt’s approach was somewhat
                hesitant or not entirely revolutionary in a broader
                international context.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Freedom from Want: </b>Roosevelt promised "freedom from
                want", which was a critical component of the welfare state.
                Roosevelt’s vision went beyond just preventing poverty or
                indigence: it aimed to reduce inequality and ensure a more equal
                society. The "ceiling on inequality" was a crucial part of this
                vision, as welfarism sought not only to prevent poverty but to
                promote a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and power. His
                highest promise, as expressed in the text was not a floor of
                protection for the masses, but the end of special privilages for
                the low.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>National, Not Global Organization: </b>Although Roosevelt
                spoke of “freedom from want” being "everywhere in the world",
                his vision was essentially national, focusing on American
                citizens and American governance. This stood in contrast to the
                universal ideals that would later come to dominate human rights
                discourse, which increasingly wanted global frameworks (such as
                the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948).
                Roosevelt’s welfare vision was grounded in the national context,
                limiting its scope and effectiveness when compared to global
                aspirations. This shift from national to international thinking
                is seen as a missed opportunity for creating a broader, more
                global vision of social rights.

              <li>
                <b>Human rights as part of national welfarism: </b>In the 1940s,
                human rights were not primarily an international concept but
                were closely linked to national welfarism. They were part of
                efforts to rebuild nations after the war, with a focus on
                societal reconstruction within individual countries, rather than
                a global agenda, except for the International Labour
                Organization.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Welfarism as a national project: </b>Welfarism, including
                socio-economic rights, was achieved and pursued on a national
                level across the world. The Universal Declaration of Human
                Rights (UDHR), although international in form, was meant as a
                guideline for individual nations to follow, emphasizing national
                sovereignty in addressing socio-economic rights.

                <b>Limitation of International socialism to national scale: </b
                >Before and during the early 20th century, many socialists
                advocated for global solutions to economic inequality and social
                justice. The idea was that socialism would be implemented
                worldwide, aiming for a global transformation in which wealth,
                power, and resources would be redistributed equitably across
                nations. After the war, this internationalist vision of
                socialism was largely replaced by a national approach. Instead
                of focusing on worldwide revolution, countries began to
                implement socialist-inspired policies within their own borders.
                This transformation involved countries focusing on improving the
                welfare of their citizens through state intervention in economic
                affairs, like social safety nets, healthcare, and education. In
                Eastern Europe, many countries embraced communism, where the
                state controlled most aspects of the economy. In Western Europe,
                even countries that didn't fully adopt socialism (like the UK or
                France) implemented social welfare systems to ensure citizens
                had access to basic needs.

              <li>
                <b>Role of the UDHR: </b>The Universal Declaration of Human
                Rights (UDHR) was seen as setting the minimum standards for
                socio-economic guarantees within the framework of each nation's
                welfare state. It offered a baseline for what countries should
                strive for within their own borders, not a model for global
                welfare.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Political Economy: </b>Political economy expanded beyond
                national borders in the 1940s with the formation of the Marshall
                Plan of the US, foundation of the IMF, but this expansion was
                driven by the need to prevent economic collapse, not for the
                purpose of creating a global welfare system or addressing global
                inequality.

          <h1><center>Themes of the essay</center></h1>

          <b>The Disconnect Between Human Rights and Economic Inequality</b>
          <p>
            Moyn argues that the human rights movement has primarily focused on
            civil and political rights, neglecting the structural causes of
            economic inequality. The movement has failed to address social and
            economic justice, such as access to healthcare, education, and fair
            wages, which are crucial for real equality.
          </p>

          <b>Human Rights as a Cosmetic Reform</b>
          <p>
            The human rights framework is critiqued as a tool for superficial
            reform that doesn’t challenge the deep-rooted economic and political
            systems, especially global capitalism. While human rights rhetoric
            has advanced individual freedoms, it often coexists with, rather
            than confronts, systems of inequality, making it more about
            legitimizing the status quo than achieving real change.
          </p>

          <b>The Role of Neoliberalism</b>
          <p>
            Human rights discourse has often aligned with neoliberal policies,
            which prioritize market-driven solutions and individual freedoms
            over social welfare, thus reinforcing economic inequalities.
            Neoliberalism and human rights have been intertwined, especially in
            emphasizing personal freedoms without addressing the economic
            structures that perpetuate disparity.
          </p>

          <b>Historical Evolution of Human Rights</b>
          <p>
            The rise of human rights in the post-World War II period coincided
            with the solidification of global capitalism. The movement
            emphasized individual rights, particularly civil and political
            freedoms, while neglecting the collective social rights necessary
            for addressing economic inequality. This historical shift limited
            the potential of human rights to confront systemic inequality.
          </p>

          <b>The Moral and Political Limits of Human Rights</b>
          <p>
            While human rights have moral significance, Moyn argues they cannot
            bring about substantial societal change on their own, particularly
            in addressing the global economic order. The focus on individual
            liberties often overshadows the need for collective action to
            address the structural inequalities within capitalism.

          <h1><center>Major Literary Devices</center></h1>

          <b>Parable</b>
          <p>
            <i
              >"Imagine that one man owned everything. Call him Croesus, after
              the king of ancient lore who, Herodotus says, was so 'wonderfully
              rich' that he 'thought himself the happiest of mortals.'" </i
            ><br />
            Moyn opens the essay with a parable about a modern-day version of
            Croesus, the rich ancient king. This fictional example serves as a
            critical metaphor for understanding the contradictions within modern
            human rights frameworks. Croesus, despite his extreme wealth,
            creates a "floor of protection" to prevent destitution, which mimics
            modern human rights efforts. However, the "floor" coexists with
            profound inequality, raising questions about whether such a system
            can truly be just.
          </p>

          <b>Metaphor</b>
          <p>
            <i
              >"For the value of distributive equality – any ceiling on the
              wealth gap between rich and poor – is as absent from the Universal
              Declaration, as well as from the legal regimes and social
              movements that take it as their polestar, as it is far from
              Croesus’s mind." </i
            ><br />
            Here, Moyn uses the metaphor of a "ceiling" on inequality to
            describe the absence of mechanisms that limit wealth disparity in
            human rights frameworks. While human rights documents assert
            equality in terms of status and dignity, they do not address the
            economic divide, allowing systems like Croesus’s to persist. The
            metaphor effectively communicates how human rights, in their current
            form, do not engage with the issue of economic inequality.
          </p>

          <b>Hyperbole</b>
          <p>
            <i
              >"Croesus outstrips the already fabulous wealth of his predecessor
              by a long shot." </i
            ><br />
            The hyperbole here exaggerates the wealth of Croesus, implying that
            his wealth is almost unimaginable compared to the already vast
            fortunes of historical figures. This exaggeration helps underscore
            the extreme wealth inequality that is at the heart of Moyn’s
            critique. It highlights how contemporary systems could allow for
            wealth to become so disproportionate that even with human rights
            protections in place, it remains an unsustainable and unjust
            situation.
          </p>

          <b>Irony</b>
          <p>
            <i
              >"How could anyone trivialize what Croesus has to offer?"
              "Croesus’s generosity, then, is as unprecedented as his wealth
              is." </i
            ><br />
            This is ironic because Moyn is highlighting how Croesus’s benevolent
            actions (like providing a basic floor of protection) could be
            considered idealistic and generous. However, the irony lies in the
            fact that, despite offering such a "utopian" vision of protection,
            Croesus’s world still allows for massive inequality. The irony lies
            in the idea that a world with extreme wealth disparity could still
            be seen as a desirable or benevolent place.
          </p>

          <b>Juxtaposition</b>
          <p>
            <i
              >"True, the founding document of human rights announced status
              equality: according to its first article, all human beings are
              born free and equal in dignity and rights. It may be true that, in
              a world devastated by the evils of racism and genocide, the
              assertion of bare status equality was itself a revolutionary act.
              Yet this same status equality implies nothing more." </i
            ><br />
            Moyn juxtaposes the idea of "status equality" in the Universal
            Declaration of Human Rights with the reality that this declaration
            does not address wealth or economic inequality. While status
            equality (the notion that all humans are equal in dignity and
            rights) was a revolutionary idea, it is insufficient in addressing
            broader social and economic issues. This comparison highlights the
            gap between the ideals of human rights and their real-world
            applications, especially in terms of economic justice.
          </p>

          <b>Rhetorical questions</b>
          <p>
            <i
              >"How could anyone trivialize what Croesus has to offer?" "Could a
              different form of human rights than the regimes and movements
              spawned so far correct this mistake?" </i
            ><br />

          <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

          <p id="p0" class="tooltip-container">
            Start with a parable: Imagine that one man owned everything. Call
            him Croesus, after the king of ancient lore who, Herodotus says, was
            so “wonderfully rich” that he “thought himself the happiest of
            mortals.” Impossibly elevated above his fellow men and women though
            he is, however, this modern Croesus is also remarkably magnanimous.
            With his global realm, the modern Croesus outstrips the already
            fabulous wealth of his predecessor by a long shot. But he does not
            want everyone else to starve, and not only because he needs some of
            them for the upkeep of his global estate. Instead, Croesus insists
            on a floor of protection, so that everyone living under his
            benevolent but total ascendancy can escape utter destitution.
            Health, food, water, even paid vacations – Croesus funds them all.
          </p>

          <p id="p1" class="tooltip-container">
            In comparison to the world in which we live today, where few enjoy
            these benefits, Croesus offers a kind of utopia. It is the utopia
            foreseen in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), whose
            goal is to provide a list of the most basic entitlements that humans
            deserve thanks to being human itself. This utopia is one that,
            though little known in its own time, has become our own, with the
            rise in the last half-century of the international human rights
            movement – especially now that this movement has belatedly turned to
            mobilization for the economic and social rights that the Universal
            Declaration promised from the start.
          </p>

          <p id="p2" class="tooltip-container">
            We increasingly live in Croesus’s world. It now goes without saying
            that any enlightened regime respects basic civil liberties, though
            the struggle to provide them is compelling and unending. Croesus
            hates repression and not merely indigence. He would never consent to
            a police state; he views the atrocities of war and occupation with
            horror; he glows with outrage when the word ‘torture’ is mentioned;
            he agrees cruelty is the worst thing we can do. But he also
            considers it outrageous, even as the sole inhabitant of the top, to
            live in a world of socio-economic destitution at the bottom.
            So-called ‘social rights’ matter deeply to him. Croesus’s
            generosity, then, is as unprecedented as his wealth is. How could
            anyone trivialize what Croesus has to offer?
          </p>

          <p id="p3" class="tooltip-container">
            Let me try. For the value of distributive equality – any ceiling on
            the wealth gap between rich and poor – is as absent from the
            Universal Declaration, as well as from the legal regimes and social
            movements that take it as their polestar, as it is far from
            Croesus’s mind. True, the founding document of human rights
            announced status equality: according to its first article, all human
            beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. It may be true
            that, in a world devastated by the evils of racism and genocide, the
            assertion of bare status equality was itself a revolutionary act.
            Yet this same status equality implies nothing more. Nothing in the
            scheme of human rights rules out Croesus’s world, with its absolute
            overlordship, so long as it features that floor of protection.
          </p>

          <p id="p4" class="tooltip-container">
            In itself, Croesus’ willing provision of a floor of protection seems
            deeply flawed – immoral even – if it comes together with the most
            massive inequality ever seen. This is the point of the thought
            experiment: to remind us that human rights, even perfectly realized
            human rights, are compatible with inequality, even radical
            inequality. Staggeringly, we could live in a situation of absolute
            hierarchy like Croesus’s world, with human rights norms as they have
            been canonically formulated perfectly respected. Our question is
            whether we should continue to idealize Croesus’s world as we
            continue to make our world more like it every day.
          </p>

          <p><b>Human rights in the age of national welfare</b></p>

          <p id="p5" class="tooltip-container">
            Writing the history of human rights in relation to that of political
            economy would involve two big stages – with a possible missed
            opportunity in between. The first, clearly, was the heroic age of
            the national welfare states after World War II. At that time, human
            rights reflected a small part of a larger and universal welfarist
            consensus that united the otherwise bitter enemies of the new cold
            war in 1948 and for two decades after. Contrary to stereotype, the
            ‘West’ for a long moment agreed about the importance of
            socio-economic rights. Indeed, it was in part out of their own
            experience of socio-economic misery, and not only the threatening
            communist insistence on an absolute ceiling on inequality, that the
            capitalist nations signed on so enthusiastically to welfarism. Of
            course, America never got as far in answering the welfarist
            imperative as those European nations that chose Christian Democracy,
            social democracy, or (in the east) communist egalitarianism. But the
            reigning consensus even in the capitalist nations in that lost age
            went far beyond a basic floor of protection to include its own
            exacting ideal of a ceiling on inequality, which to a remarkable
            extent they succeeded (like the communist nations) in building to
            accompany their new floor of entitlements.
          </p>

          <p id="p6" class="tooltip-container">
            Indeed, it is perhaps because human rights offered a modest first
            step rather than a grand final hope that they were broadly ignored
            or rejected in the 1940s as the ultimate formulation of the good
            life. The assertion of human rights in the 1940s, in other words, is
            best understood as one version of the update to the entitlements of
            citizenship on whose desirability and necessity almost everyone
            agreed after depression and war. Franklin Roosevelt issued his
            famous call for a “second Bill of Rights” that included
            socio-economic protections in his State of the Union address the
            year before his death, but the most important three facts about that
            call have been almost entirely missed. One is that it marked a
            characteristically provincial America’s late and ginger entry into
            an already foreordained North Atlantic consensus. A second is that
            in promising “freedom from want” and envisioning it “everywhere in
            the world”, Roosevelt in fact understated the actually egalitarian
            aspirations that every version of welfarism proclaimed, which went
            far beyond a low bar against indigence so as to guarantee a more
            equal society than before (or since). His highest promise, in his
            speech, was not a floor of protection for the masses but the end of
            “special privileges for the few” – a ceiling on inequality. The last
            is that though Roosevelt certainly hoped it would span the globe, it
            was to be nationally rather than internationally organized – in
            stark contrast to the assumptions of both political economy and
            human rights as they have prevailed in our time.
          </p>

          <p id="p7" class="tooltip-container">
            The most interesting truth about human rights in the 1940s, indeed,
            is not that they were an optional and normally ignored synonym for a
            consensus welfarism but that they still portended a fully national
            project of reconstruction – just like all other reigning versions of
            welfarism. Everywhere in the world, and not least in Roosevelt’s
            America itself, welfarism was both announced and achieved on a
            national basis. The minor exception of the International Labour
            Organization to one side, in the 1940s, neither socio-economic
            rights nor a more ambitious welfarism were international projects,
            except insofar as modular nation-states experimenting with their own
            arrangements were supposed to answer to higher values of morality.
            Of course the Universal Declaration is international in source and
            form, but essentially as a template for nations – “a high standard
            of achievement for all peoples and nations”, as its own preamble
            tells us. This ought to be unsurprising. Welfarism had been national
            ever since the crisis between the world wars prompted state-led
            reconstruction. If ‘national socialism’ did not triumph as a slogan
            or a programme after World War II, it was in part because the name
            was taken but mainly because a more ecumenical national welfarism–
            my label – structured a debate about how far (not whether) the state
            would intervene into economic affairs to plan and manage growth,
            with a range of options from tweaked capitalism to full-blown
            communism. Indeed, a once more internationalist socialism had been
            reduced to the scale of the nation. Having never ascended above it,
            ‘welfarism in one country’ was the rule where full-blown socialism
            did not obtain, like various places in Western and everywhere in
            Eastern Europe.
          </p>

          <p id="p8" class="tooltip-container">
            Political economy ascended beyond the nation in the 1940s only for
            the sake of avoiding catastrophe if individual states failed in
            their obligation of countercyclical management of their own
            economies, never for the sake of either a global floor of
            protection, let alone a global ceiling on inequality. As economist
            and Nobel laureate Gunnar Myrdal explained laconically, looking back
            at this consensus about the geographical limits but relative
            generosity of post-war distributive justice, “the welfare state is
            nationalistic” (Myrdal 1960). The original relation of the Universal
            Declaration to political economy was thus the lowest set of
            guarantees for which the national welfarist experiment should
            strive, when conducted in the modular boxes provided – and divided –
            by political borders.
          </p>

          <p id="p9" class="tooltip-container">
            The harmony of ideals between the campaign against abjection and the
            demand for equality succeeded only nationally, and in mostly North
            Atlantic states, and then only partially. Whatever success occurred
            on both fronts thus came with sharp limitations – and especially the
            geographical modesty that the human rights idiom has successfully
            transcended. It is, indeed, as if globalization of the norms of
            basic protection were a kind of reward for the relinquishment of the
            imperative of local equality.
          </p>

          <p id="p10" class="tooltip-container">
            Even the decolonization of the world, though unforeseen at the time
            of the Universal Declaration that accommodated itself to the empires
            of the day, hardly changed this relationship, since the new states
            themselves adopted the national welfarist resolve. The burning
            question was what would happen after, especially in the face of the
            inability of the Global South to transplant national welfarism and
            the wealth gap that endures to this day between two sorts of
            countries: rich and poor.
          </p>

          <p><b>Another human rights movement?</b></p>

          <p id="p11" class="tooltip-container">
            Could a different form of human rights than the regimes and
            movements spawned so far correct this mistake? I doubt it. To be
            absolutely clear, this is not to contradict the moral significance
            and possibly even historical success of human rights when it comes
            to their core uses in combating political repression and restraining
            excessive violence. But when inequality has been contained in human
            affairs, it was never on the sort of individualistic, and often
            antistatist, basis that human rights do indeed share with their
            market fundamentalist Doppelganger. And when it comes to the
            necessary mobilizational complement to any programme, the chief
            tools of the human rights movements in its most renowned and
            possibly successful campaigns – the critique of state repression and
            the melioration of disasters of war – are simply not fit for use in
            the socio-economic domain. It is in part because the human rights
            movement is not up to the challenge when it comes to each and every
            of its self-assigned tasks that it has been condemned to offer no
            meaningful alternative, and certainly no serious threat, to market
            fundamentalism. The success and prestige of human rights in our day
            – and the absence of other political approaches – has bred the
            mistake of the man who, lacking anything but a hammer, then treats
            everything like a nail. Croesus’s world is safe from the drastic
            mismatch between need and remedy as human rights regimes and
            movements so far can present it.
          </p>

          <p id="p12" class="tooltip-container">
            In Herodotus’s Histories, Solon’s shaming of Croesus merely took him
            down a peg. It was only Persian armies that toppled him. The truth
            is that global socio-economic justice, like local socio-economic
            justice, would require redistribution under pressure from the rich
            to the poor, something naming and shaming is never likely to
            achieve, even when supplemented by novel forms of legal activism.
            Thinking historically, it can be no accident that the era of the
            moderation of inequality in the mid-twentieth century was also the
            age of both totalitarian regimes and a cold war that exacted an
            appalling toll on the world, including at the hands of the ultimate
            victor. At the zenith of national welfare, a floor of protection
            came linked to a ceiling on inequality, and both were built
            together, only in the presence of frightening internal and external
            threats – a workers’ movement and a communist menace. In response to
            those dangers, change came thanks to a ‘reformism of fear’ – the
            working class was placated and untold violence was brought against
            enemies, often at home and always abroad.
          </p>

          <p id="p13" class="tooltip-container">
            Yet if the human rights movement at its most inspiring has
            stigmatized such repression and violence, it has never offered a
            functional replacement for the sense of fear that led to both
            protection and redistribution for those who were left alive by
            twentieth century horror. If a global welfarism is ever to be
            brought out the realm of the ideal where it is currently exiled, it
            will need to be championed not only as a programme but also by a
            movement. But it will not look like our human rights movement, which
            has become prominent as our world has become more like Croesus’s
            world each day. None of this is to say that human rights activism,
            to which Amnesty International made such an epoch-making and
            defining contribution in the last century, is irrelevant.
          </p>
          <p id="p14" class="tooltip-container">
            The stigmatization of states and communities that fail to protect
            basic values is – so long as it is not selective and a smokescreen
            for great power politics – a tremendous contribution. But human
            rights advocates in their current guises do not know how to
            stigmatize inequality, and not principles but a new political
            economy would have to be invented to actually moderate it. Most of
            all, history suggests that they are the wrong kind of agent: not
            fearful enough to provoke redistribution. Could a new form of human
            rights mount such a challenge? Possibly, but it would need to be so
            different as to be unrecognizable, and threaten the power to
            stigmatize in the face of the violation of basic values that
            activists have carefully and with much hard work learned to achieve.
            If this is correct, human rights movements face a deeply strategic
            choice about whether to try to reinvent themselves – or whether to
