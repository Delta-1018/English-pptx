              <strong>King of Lydia:</strong> Croesus was the king of Lydia,
              located in present-day Turkey. He ruled from around 595 BC to 546
              BC.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Extremely Rich:</strong> Croesus gained incredible wealth
              through his ancestral fortune and control over the gold-rich
              Pactolus River.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Happiest of Mortals:</strong> He famously considered
              himself the happiest of mortals, especially after consulting the
              Oracle of Delphi. (The Oracle of Delphi predicted that crossing
              the river would destroy a great empire. Croesus misinterpreted
              this as Persia's downfall, inflating his ego and making him feel
              the wealthiest, strongest, and happiest of mortals. However, it
              was his own kingdom that was ultimately destroyed.)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Treatment of His People:</strong> Croesus ensured his
              people’s needs were met, providing essentials such as health,
              food, water and even paid vacations while maintaining firm control
              over his rule.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Defeat: </strong> Croesus was eventually defeated by Cyrus
              the Great of Persia, marking the fall of Lydia and the end of his
              reign.

          <p id="normal-txt">
            Samuel Moyn is an American historian and legal scholar specializing
            in intellectual history, human rights, and political thought. He is
            a professor at Yale University, where he teaches in both the Law
            School and the History Department. Moyn is widely recognized for his
            critical examination of the development of human rights, arguing
            that the modern concept emerged primarily in the 1970s rather than
            being a long-standing tradition. His work challenges conventional
            narratives, questioning whether human rights have truly been an
            effective tool for justice or if they have been used to justify
            global inequalities. One of his most influential books, The Last
            Utopia: Human Rights in History (2010), argues that human rights,
            rather than being a direct continuation of earlier ideals like the
            Enlightenment or the French Revolution, only gained prominence after
            World War II and particularly in the 1970s. He critiques the idea
            that human rights are a timeless moral principle and instead views
            them as a historical response to the decline of alternative utopian
            ideologies like socialism and nationalism. His later works, such as
            Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World (2018), further explore
            how human rights have failed to address economic inequality,
            emphasizing that focusing on rights without tackling material
            conditions can lead to a shallow vision of justice. Beyond human
            rights, Moyn has also contributed to debates on war, ethics, and the
            law. In Humane: How the United States Abandoned Peace and Reinvented
            War (2021), he critiques the idea that making war more ethical—by
            reducing civilian casualties or using precision strikes—has actually
            made warfare more acceptable and prolonged conflicts. His
            scholarship blends historical analysis with political critique,
            making his work influential in both academic and policy discussions.
            Through his writings, Moyn continues to challenge mainstream
            perspectives on human rights, war, and global justice, encouraging
            deeper reflection on how these ideas shape the modern world.

        <section id="text-book">
          <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
          <p>
            Start with a parable: Imagine that one man owned everything. Call
            him Croesus, after the king of ancient lore who, Herodotus says, was
            so “wonderfully rich” that he “thought himself the happiest of
            mortals.” Impossibly elevated above his fellow men and women though
            he is, however, this modern Croesus is also remarkably magnanimous.
            With his global realm, the modern Croesus outstrips the already
            fabulous wealth of his predecessor by a long shot. But he does not
            want everyone else to starve, and not only because he needs some of
            them for the upkeep of his global estate. Instead, Croesus insists
            on a floor of protection, so that everyone living under his
            benevolent but total ascendancy can escape utter destitution.
            Health, food, water, even paid vacations – Croesus funds them all.
          </p>

          <p>
            In comparison to the world in which we live today, where few enjoy
            these benefits, Croesus offers a kind of utopia. It is the utopia
            foreseen in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), whose
            goal is to provide a list of the most basic entitlements that humans
            deserve thanks to being human itself. This utopia is one that,
            though little known in its own time, has become our own, with the
            rise in the last half-century of the international human rights
            movement – especially now that this movement has belatedly turned to
            mobilization for the economic and social rights that the Universal
            Declaration promised from the start.
          </p>

          <p>
            We increasingly live in Croesus’s world. It now goes without saying
            that any enlightened regime respects basic civil liberties, though
            the struggle to provide them is compelling and unending. Croesus
            hates repression and not merely indigence. He would never consent to
            a police state; he views the atrocities of war and occupation with
            horror; he glows with outrage when the word ‘torture’ is mentioned;
            he agrees cruelty is the worst thing we can do. But he also
            considers it outrageous, even as the sole inhabitant of the top, to
            live in a world of socio-economic destitution at the bottom.
            So-called ‘social rights’ matter deeply to him. Croesus’s
            generosity, then, is as unprecedented as his wealth is. How could
            anyone trivialize what Croesus has to offer?
          </p>

          <p>
            Let me try. For the value of distributive equality – any ceiling on
            the wealth gap between rich and poor – is as absent from the
            Universal Declaration, as well as from the legal regimes and social
            movements that take it as their polestar, as it is far from
            Croesus’s mind. True, the founding document of human rights
            announced status equality: according to its first article, all human
            beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. It may be true
            that, in a world devastated by the evils of racism and genocide, the
            assertion of bare status equality was itself a revolutionary act.
            Yet this same status equality implies nothing more. Nothing in the
            scheme of human rights rules out Croesus’s world, with its absolute
            overlordship, so long as it features that floor of protection.
          </p>

          <p>
            In itself, Croesus’ willing provision of a floor of protection seems
            deeply flawed – immoral even – if it comes together with the most
            massive inequality ever seen. This is the point of the thought
            experiment: to remind us that human rights, even perfectly realized
            human rights, are compatible with inequality, even radical
            inequality. Staggeringly, we could live in a situation of absolute
            hierarchy like Croesus’s world, with human rights norms as they have
            been canonically formulated perfectly respected. Our question is
            whether we should continue to idealize Croesus’s world as we
            continue to make our world more like it every day.
          </p>

          <p><b>Human rights in the age of national welfare</b></p>

          <p>
            Writing the history of human rights in relation to that of political
            economy would involve two big stages – with a possible missed
            opportunity in between. The first, clearly, was the heroic age of
            the national welfare states after World War II. At that time, human
            rights reflected a small part of a larger and universal welfarist
            consensus that united the otherwise bitter enemies of the new cold
            war in 1948 and for two decades after. Contrary to stereotype, the
            ‘West’ for a long moment agreed about the importance of
            socio-economic rights. Indeed, it was in part out of their own
            experience of socio-economic misery, and not only the threatening
            communist insistence on an absolute ceiling on inequality, that the
            capitalist nations signed on so enthusiastically to welfarism. Of
            course, America never got as far in answering the welfarist
            imperative as those European nations that chose Christian Democracy,
            social democracy, or (in the east) communist egalitarianism. But the
            reigning consensus even in the capitalist nations in that lost age
            went far beyond a basic floor of protection to include its own
            exacting ideal of a ceiling on inequality, which to a remarkable
            extent they succeeded (like the communist nations) in building to
            accompany their new floor of entitlements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Indeed, it is perhaps because human rights offered a modest first
            step rather than a grand final hope that they were broadly ignored
            or rejected in the 1940s as the ultimate formulation of the good
            life. The assertion of human rights in the 1940s, in other words, is
            best understood as one version of the update to the entitlements of
            citizenship on whose desirability and necessity almost everyone
            agreed after depression and war. Franklin Roosevelt issued his
            famous call for a “second Bill of Rights” that included
            socio-economic protections in his State of the Union address the
            year before his death, but the most important three facts about that
            call have been almost entirely missed. One is that it marked a
            characteristically provincial America’s late and ginger entry into
            an already foreordained North Atlantic consensus. A second is that
            in promising “freedom from want” and envisioning it “everywhere in
            the world”, Roosevelt in fact understated the actually egalitarian
            aspirations that every version of welfarism proclaimed, which went
            far beyond a low bar against indigence so as to guarantee a more
            equal society than before (or since). His highest promise, in his
            speech, was not a floor of protection for the masses but the end of
            “special privileges for the few” – a ceiling on inequality. The last
            is that though Roosevelt certainly hoped it would span the globe, it
            was to be nationally rather than internationally organized – in
            stark contrast to the assumptions of both political economy and
            human rights as they have prevailed in our time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most interesting truth about human rights in the 1940s, indeed,
            is not that they were an optional and normally ignored synonym for a
            consensus welfarism but that they still portended a fully national
            project of reconstruction – just like all other reigning versions of
            welfarism. Everywhere in the world, and not least in Roosevelt’s
            America itself, welfarism was both announced and achieved on a
            national basis. The minor exception of the International Labour
            Organization to one side, in the 1940s, neither socio-economic
            rights nor a more ambitious welfarism were international projects,
            except insofar as modular nation-states experimenting with their own
            arrangements were supposed to answer to higher values of morality.
            Of course the Universal Declaration is international in source and
            form, but essentially as a template for nations – “a high standard
            of achievement for all peoples and nations”, as its own preamble
            tells us. This ought to be unsurprising. Welfarism had been national
            ever since the crisis between the world wars prompted state-led
            reconstruction. If ‘national socialism’ did not triumph as a slogan
            or a programme after World War II, it was in part because the name
            was taken but mainly because a more ecumenical national welfarism–
            my label – structured a debate about how far (not whether) the state
            would intervene into economic affairs to plan and manage growth,
            with a range of options from tweaked capitalism to full-blown
            communism. Indeed, a once more internationalist socialism had been
            reduced to the scale of the nation. Having never ascended above it,
            ‘welfarism in one country’ was the rule where full-blown socialism
            did not obtain, like various places in Western and everywhere in
            Eastern Europe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Political economy ascended beyond the nation in the 1940s only for
            the sake of avoiding catastrophe if individual states failed in
            their obligation of countercyclical management of their own
            economies, never for the sake of either a global floor of
            protection, let alone a global ceiling on inequality. As economist
            and Nobel laureate Gunnar Myrdal explained laconically, looking back
            at this consensus about the geographical limits but relative
            generosity of post-war distributive justice, “the welfare state is
            nationalistic” (Myrdal 1960). The original relation of the Universal
            Declaration to political economy was thus the lowest set of
            guarantees for which the national welfarist experiment should
            strive, when conducted in the modular boxes provided – and divided –
            by political borders.
          </p>

          <p>
            The harmony of ideals between the campaign against abjection and the
            demand for equality succeeded only nationally, and in mostly North
            Atlantic states, and then only partially. Whatever success occurred
            on both fronts thus came with sharp limitations – and especially the
            geographical modesty that the human rights idiom has successfully
            transcended. It is, indeed, as if globalization of the norms of
            basic protection were a kind of reward for the relinquishment of the
            imperative of local equality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even the decolonization of the world, though unforeseen at the time
            of the Universal Declaration that accommodated itself to the empires
            of the day, hardly changed this relationship, since the new states
            themselves adopted the national welfarist resolve. The burning
            question was what would happen after, especially in the face of the
            inability of the Global South to transplant national welfarism and
            the wealth gap that endures to this day between two sorts of
            countries: rich and poor.
          </p>

          <p><b>Another human rights movement?</b></p>

          <p>
            Could a different form of human rights than the regimes and
            movements spawned so far correct this mistake? I doubt it. To be
            absolutely clear, this is not to contradict the moral significance
            and possibly even historical success of human rights when it comes
            to their core uses in combating political repression and restraining
            excessive violence. But when inequality has been contained in human
            affairs, it was never on the sort of individualistic, and often
            antistatist, basis that human rights do indeed share with their
            market fundamentalist Doppelganger. And when it comes to the
            necessary mobilizational complement to any programme, the chief
            tools of the human rights movements in its most renowned and
            possibly successful campaigns – the critique of state repression and
            the melioration of disasters of war – are simply not fit for use in
            the socio-economic domain. It is in part because the human rights
            movement is not up to the challenge when it comes to each and every
            of its self-assigned tasks that it has been condemned to offer no
            meaningful alternative, and certainly no serious threat, to market
            fundamentalism. The success and prestige of human rights in our day
            – and the absence of other political approaches – has bred the
            mistake of the man who, lacking anything but a hammer, then treats
            everything like a nail. Croesus’s world is safe from the drastic
            mismatch between need and remedy as human rights regimes and
            movements so far can present it.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Herodotus’s Histories, Solon’s shaming of Croesus merely took him
            down a peg. It was only Persian armies that toppled him. The truth
            is that global socio-economic justice, like local socio-economic
            justice, would require redistribution under pressure from the rich
            to the poor, something naming and shaming is never likely to
            achieve, even when supplemented by novel forms of legal activism.
            Thinking historically, it can be no accident that the era of the
            moderation of inequality in the mid-twentieth century was also the
            age of both totalitarian regimes and a cold war that exacted an
            appalling toll on the world, including at the hands of the ultimate
            victor. At the zenith of national welfare, a floor of protection
            came linked to a ceiling on inequality, and both were built
            together, only in the presence of frightening internal and external
            threats – a workers’ movement and a communist menace. In response to
            those dangers, change came thanks to a ‘reformism of fear’ – the
            working class was placated and untold violence was brought against
            enemies, often at home and always abroad.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet if the human rights movement at its most inspiring has
            stigmatized such repression and violence, it has never offered a
            functional replacement for the sense of fear that led to both
            protection and redistribution for those who were left alive by
            twentieth century horror. If a global welfarism is ever to be
            brought out the realm of the ideal where it is currently exiled, it
            will need to be championed not only as a programme but also by a
            movement. But it will not look like our human rights movement, which
            has become prominent as our world has become more like Croesus’s
            world each day. None of this is to say that human rights activism,
            to which Amnesty International made such an epoch-making and
            defining contribution in the last century, is irrelevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stigmatization of states and communities that fail to protect
            basic values is – so long as it is not selective and a smokescreen
            for great power politics – a tremendous contribution. But human
            rights advocates in their current guises do not know how to
            stigmatize inequality, and not principles but a new political
            economy would have to be invented to actually moderate it. Most of
            all, history suggests that they are the wrong kind of agent: not
            fearful enough to provoke redistribution. Could a new form of human
            rights mount such a challenge? Possibly, but it would need to be so
            different as to be unrecognizable, and threaten the power to
            stigmatize in the face of the violation of basic values that
            activists have carefully and with much hard work learned to achieve.
            If this is correct, human rights movements face a deeply strategic
            choice about whether to try to reinvent themselves – or whether to
            stand aside on the assumption that as inequality grows, someday its
            opponent will arise. Until then, Croesus’s world is our common fate.
